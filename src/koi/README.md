# koi core
Handles the common needs of javascript web applications, defines a namespace
for customized extension. The koi system requires jQuery (1.6.4).

# Startup
When a koi application is being executed, it progresses through six (6) stages
of setup. Once all stages are completed, KOI dispatches its ready event, which 
indicates that the application is stable and can now be used.

In a technical sense, the entire startup sequence of a koi application refers
to everything that happens before the ready event is dispatched. Within koi,
the ready event being dispatched is dependent on the `KOI.readyQueue` object.

The ready queue is simply an object which contains named booleans. The koi core
will dispatch its ready event only when `KOI.makeReady()` is called and the
ready queue contains no keys which are "false".

The point of handling readying in this way is to allow arbitrary delay of the
ready event. For example:
    KOI.readyQueue.foobar = false;
    KOI.makeReady(); // No effect
    KOI.readyQueue.foobar = true;
    KOI.makeReady(); // Triggers the ready event

The application code itself is responsible for kicking off some stages of the
process. This is to allow applications to meter the execution of their startup.
These application-driven stages are indicated with an asterisk. 

## 1. Code loading
The first step of any application's execution is to include its code. This
process is handled differently between the development environment and any
release code.

### Development
When in the development environment, a koi application's code-loading is
managed by the koi bootstrap. During the development process, the bootstrap 
creates and processes an application's dependency tree and loads resources 
dynamically. Once all the application code has finished loading, the koi
bootstrap marks the code as having been loaded.

### Release
For release code generated by a build system, a koi application's code-loading
is implicit.

Unlike development, when release code is executed, all of the application code
is condensed into a single script. Because there is no on-demand loading, the
fact that the application has loaded is sufficient to progress past this step.
